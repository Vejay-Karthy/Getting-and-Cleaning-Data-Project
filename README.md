# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
Week 4 Peer Graded Assignment


This Repository is created for the Peer Graded Assignment (Week 4) for the course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

This repo includes the necessary files for this assignment.

They are:

CodeBook.md, 

run_analysis.R, 

tidydata.txt



CodeBook.md: Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that has been performed to clean up the data.



run_analysis.R: 

1. Download and unzip the data file into your R working directory.

2. Download the R source code into your R working directory.

3. Execute R source code to generate tidydata.txt file.



The code in this file does the below mentioned functionalities:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity 
  and each subject.




tidydata.txt: Required output after the code has been executed.
